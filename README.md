- Generic:
    - Improved avatar photo picker and camera orientation handling

    - Improved stereo support for AVFoundation / OpenAL

    - OpenAL: Within game code, setting a negative value through
      alSourcef(x, AL_GAIN, volume) could cause iOS 8 mediaserverd to hang
      and cause multiple side effects until the device is rebooted, fixed

    - everyplayFaceCamRecordingPermission delegate improvements

### v1.8.3 - Oct 1st 2014 (build 1830)

- Generic:
    - Now supports iOS 8 SDK / Xcode6 GM

    - Fixed recording support against apps supporting the new
      native resolutions of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus on iOS 8

    - Workaround [UIView layoutSubViews] behaviour on iOS 8:

      Depending on game engine used and how the view handling is implemented,
      transitioning between views may trigger layoutSubViews and during the
      process, re-create OpenGL buffers. In some cases, calling EAGLContext
      renderbufferStorage:fromDrawable fails and may result to frozen graphics

      This behaviour is mostly seen on some custom engines and cocos2d

    - Setting [Everyplay sharedInstance].capture property to nil
      could reset certain default settings to unwanted state, such
      as lowering target video framerate from the default, fixed

      As a result, there's less audio interruptions and potential issues that
      could cause losing audio output, recorded audio to be silent or go out
      of sync, mediaserverd crashing and causing wide load of generic issues

    - Now supports AudioQueue recording against linear PCM
      and compressed formats (such as AAC)

    - The audio core is now more sample rate agnostic, but 44.1 kHz is still
      considered the optimal one

    - OpenAL: Improved source/buffer instance refcounting and thread-safety

    - OpenAL: Loading audio samples with alBufferData now prefers the
      original sample rate specified and using less memory

    - OpenAL: Loading certain audio samples caused audio clicks, fixed

    - AVFoundation: AVAudioPlayer now supports duration and numberOfChannels
      properties

    - AVFoundation: Improved audio streaming playback

    - Fixed rare race condition in graphics recording that could have
      caused dropped video frames or not adding new frames to video

    - Video editor now adds FaceCam recording UI buttons only after
      iOS user permission check

    - Now comes with Adobe AIR support:

      https://github.com/Everyplay/everyplay-air-sdk

      seamless Twitter and Facebook login support. If none are linked into
      the project, the old login conventions apply

    - The new improved Facebook login shares via Everyplay Facebook application,
      not through your existing Facebook application credentials. For immediate
      use, you might need to send your iOS bundle information or Android key
      hash to get started, please contact support@everyplay.com. We're currently
      working on making this step automated without extra work required on
      developers behalf

    - All around stability and internal handling changes to the
      video recording core

    - Further GPU optimizations against the new graphics integration, especially
      with older devices like iPhone 4S, iPad 2 and iPad 3

    - Fixed a regression on using the latest Unity package and the new
      graphics integration that resulted to broken graphics in certain
      non-target native resolution use cases (Screen.SetResolution)

      '[AVAssetWriterInput initWithMediaType:outputSettings:sourceFormatHint:]
      AVVideoSettings dictionary must specify a positive width'

    - Improved video orientation detection

    - Fixed EveryplayCapture setLowMemoryDevice property behaviour in
      some rare cases

    - Improved Cocosd2d / SpriteKit support

- Unity plugin:
    - Improved Facebook integration, this requires the use of "Facebook for Unity" asset
      available from the Asset Store

    - Lots of internal plugin changes and file location changes for better Unity integration,
      the migration should be seamless without removing previous assets

    - New prefables integration. Instead of dragging a prefab to your first scene
      you may use the Edit / Everyplay Settings menu to enable Everyplay and to
      set your game credentials. This also allows you to temporarily disable
      Everyplay without removing the package

    - Double check that clientId, secret and redirectURI settings have merged into
      the new Edit / Everyplay Settings menu after upgrading

    - Calling Everyplay through the SharedInstance is now deprecated. You may still
      use the old way, but the recommended way is to call Everyplay.methodName

    - Added checkboxes to new Everyplay settings menu for enabling Everyplay per
      platform (iOS/Android)

    - iOS Everyplay.framework and bundle are now directly embedded into the package
      and used as the only option

    - Old test button functionality in Everyplay.prefab has been moved to
      Plugins/Everyplay/Helpers/EveryplayTest.prefab. A new simplified one can
      be enabled through Edit / Everyplay Settings menu

### v1.7.6 - April 7th 2014 (build 1760)

    - Breaking API change for Live FaceCam support: Due to new iOS7
      user permission additions, it's now required to ask for a grant
      before starting sessions through [[Everyplay sharedInstance] faceCam]

      If the permission hasn't been yet asked, calling
      [[[Everyplay sharedInstance] faceCam] requestRecordingPermission];
      will bring up standard iOS permission dialog, following calls
      give the state the user previously answered

      You can later check the granted state either by using the delegate handler
      or asking from the [[Everyplay sharedInstance] faceCam].isRecordingPermissionGranted
      property

      frameworks. Sharing by mail has been extended to work from the first
      share dialog, previously it was limited to re-sharing

    - Improved framerate for the recorded video when the GPU is heavily
      utilized, also helping some older generation single-core devices
      like iPhone 4 and iPad 1

    - Added disableSingleCoreDevices boolean property to EveryplayCapture,
      to disable recording on devices with A4 chip or older

    - Added lowMemoryDevice boolean property to EveryplayCapture,
      to optimize memory usage at the cost of performance

    - Memory optimization fixes after leaving Everyplay view

    - Added [[Everyplay sharedInstance] showEveryplayWithPath:] method for
      navigating directly to a certain view, such as game id specific feeds

- Unity plugin:
    - Post-processing script now also tries to locate Everyplay.framework
      and bundle from your Unity project directory without using Spotlight,
      improving usability on constant integration / build machines

    - Post-processing script now weak links Twitter (iOS5+) and Social (iOS6+)
      frameworks to your project

    - Additional fixes to skewed graphics buffer if the orientation has changed
      between portrait and landscape modes when coming back from Everyplay view
      to the game

    - Added three new methods:
      - public void SetDisableSingleCoreDevices(bool state);

      Call [[[Everyplay sharedInstance] capture] snapshotRenderbuffer]; after
      you've drawn the core elements of your game, done

    - Continuous recording support, especially suitable for longer online gaming
      sessions. If the recording session goes over the maximum length set,
      the resulting video will have the content recorded within last N minutes

      Set [[Everyplay sharedInstance] capture].maxRecordingMinutesLength property
      to your preferred value, done

    - More improvements to framerate consistency on recorded video

    - Free disk space monitoring and related error handling

    - Fixed audio related crash with multiple audio sources

- Unity plugin:
    - Added two new methods:
      - public bool SnapshotRenderbuffer();
      - public void SetMaxRecordingMinutesLength(int minutes);

- Unity plugin:
    - Changing orientation between landscape and portrait mode resulted to skewed
      graphics buffer when returning back from Everyplay view to the game, Everyplay
      plugin now triggers a forced orientation check. For apps supporting all
      orientations for gameplay, it's recommended to lock orientation using
      RecordingStarted/RecordingStopped delegates when recording.

    - Added WasClosed delegate that triggers when returning back to the game

    - EveryplayTest script now warns when trying to trigger functionality on editor
